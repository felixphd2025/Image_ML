# Brain Tumor MRI Dataset - Model Making App
This project involves creating a model to classify brain tumors using MRI images. The dataset is available on Kaggle, and we will use popular Python libraries like Streamlit, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow to build the app and the model.

Steps to Set Up and Run the App
1. Download the Dataset
First, download the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle:

Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset/data

2. Install Required Libraries
Ensure that you have Python installed, then install the following libraries to run the app and build the model:
pip install streamlit tensorflow matplotlib

You may also need additional dependencies for specific functionalities, such as numpy, pandas, or scikit-learn, depending on the model you are building.

3. Building and Running the App
To run the Streamlit app, navigate to the project directory where the script is located and execute the following command:

streamlit run app.py
This will start a local server where you can interact with the app, visualize the MRI images, and train the model.

4. Model Development
The app will use TensorFlow to develop a deep learning model for classifying brain tumors based on MRI scans. You can explore different model architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and fine-tune them for better accuracy.

5. Visualizing the Results
Matplotlib will be used to visualize training progress, loss/accuracy curves, and the final predictions from the model. You can also visualize MRI images from the dataset for analysis.

Need Help?
If you encounter any issues or need assistance with setting up the app or training the model, feel free to reach out via email or post your question on the repositoryâ€™s issue tracker.

There are some additional elements which test the resnet efficiency, remove duplicate files and learn how the kernal is working for CNN's.
